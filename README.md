# HackMe
First timer trying to develop some games for fun..

Anagram based game developed using Unity Engine.
Guess the word from a given jumbled word to win. As the user selects the level the words get tougher.
P.S. Currently it's in beta mode.

HackMeUnity.rar contains the original unity file. HackMe.rar contains the build version of HackMeUnity.rar.

How to Play:
Download HackMe.rar file. Extract it and double click on HackMe.exe.
Enjoy.
